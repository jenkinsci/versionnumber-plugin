		The version number format string is used to generate the version number.  It will be passed through unaltered,
		except that any expression of the form ${variable_name, argument} will be replaced according to the table below.
		Arguments are option, and unless specified below, the argument is a string of length N, and the
		number will be padded with zeros until it's length N or greater.  For example, if the build day is 5, then
		${BUILD_DAY, XX} would return 05.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any variable not recognized in the table below will be replaced by an environment variable of the same name.
		So to use the hudson build ID, stored in the environment variable BUILD_ID, you'd just use ${BUILD_ID}.
		If no environment variable of the appropriate name can be found, the expression will just be replaced with
		an empty string.

			    If the argument for this is a quotes-enclosed java date format string, then this will be replaced with

		Note: BUILDS_TODAY_Z, BUILDS_THIS_MONTH_Z, BUILDS_THIS_YEAR_Z and BUILDS_ALL_TIME_Z are zero-indexed
		versions of the same variables above.  The override build numbers are NOT zero indexed, however, so if
		you override Builds Today with 3, then BUILDS_TODAY_Z will be 2 for the next build.
