		The version number format string is used to generate the version number.  It will be passed through unaltered,
		except that any expression of the form ${variable_name, argument} will be replaced according to the table below.
		Arguments are optional, and, unless otherwise specified in the table below, the argument is a string of length N,
		and the number will be left-padded with zeros until its length equals N.  It will not be padded if its length
		already exceeds N.  For example, if the build day is 5, then ${BUILD_DAY, XX} would return 05.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any variable not recognized in the table below will be replaced by an environment variable of the same name.
		So to use the hudson build ID, stored in the environment variable BUILD_ID, you'd just use ${BUILD_ID}.
		If no environment variable of the appropriate name can be found, the expression will just be replaced with
		an empty string. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To limit the size of a variable not recognized in the table below, you can do so in the form of
		${variable_name, "N"} where N is a positive or negative whole number less than the amount of characters
		in the variable. N can be in the form of "+N", "-N", or "N" where a positive number takes the first "N"
		characters from the variable and a negative number takes the last "N" characters from a variable. (A "N"
		of zero is effectively the same as if no "N" would have been given; all characters are used.) For example,
		to split up SVN_REVISION where SVN_REVISION is 123456, ${SVN_REVISION, "2"}.${SVN_REVISION, "-4"} would
		return 12.3456.
