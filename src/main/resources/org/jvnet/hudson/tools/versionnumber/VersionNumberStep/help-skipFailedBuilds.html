	<p>
	If this box is checked, failed builds will not cause the builds today/ this month/ this year/ all time to
	build numbers to be incremented for the next build.  Basically, this keeps failed builds from "eating" build
	numbers.  Other rules apply; for example, if a failed build is fixed on the first build of the next day,
	then BUILDS_TODAY will be 1 for the fixed build.
