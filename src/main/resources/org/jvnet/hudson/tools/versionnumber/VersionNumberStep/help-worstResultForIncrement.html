	<p>
		If the former build-run's result is worse than the one selected here, this will not cause the build
		numbers for builds today / this week / this month / this year / all time to be incremented for the
		next build.  Basically, this keeps "non-successful" builds from "eating" build numbers.  
		Other rules apply; for example, if a failed build is fixed on the first build of the next day, then
		BUILDS_TODAY will be 1 for the fixed build.
