# Releases of Version Number Plugin

## Version 1.10

-   Release Sep 8, 2022
-   Migrate docs to GitHub        ([PR-27](https://github.com/jenkinsci/versionnumber-plugin/pull/27)) [@AayushSaini101](https://github.com/AayushSaini101)
-   Modernize plugin development  ([PR-26](https://github.com/jenkinsci/versionnumber-plugin/pull/26)) [@AayushSaini101](https://github.com/AayushSaini101)
-   Enable Gitpod for development ([PR-25](https://github.com/jenkinsci/versionnumber-plugin/pull/25)) [@jmMeessen](https://github.com/jmMeessen)
-   Use HTTPS for development     ([PR-23](https://github.com/jenkinsci/versionnumber-plugin/pull/23)) [@daniel-beck](https://github.com/daniel-beck)

## Version 1.9

-   Release Nov 17, 2017
-   Accepted [PR-12](https://github.com/jenkinsci/versionnumber-plugin/pull/12). ("Adding
    functionality to limit the number of characters from a variable.")
-   Fixed
    bug [JENKINS-18171](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-18171). ("Version
    Number plugin doesn't increment build numbers after an unstable
    build.")  
    -   **NOTE:** This changes the checkbox for "skipping failed builds"
        (which actually meant to not increase the version-number if the
        former run was not successful) to a combobox of values.  
        The transition works smoothly and does not change the former
        behavior. However, **you should update the configuration of each
        job that had this checkbox checked (and save it)!  
        **(This assures that later updates of this plugin will not break
        your behavior due to this change.)
